## Contributing

Both feedback and contibution are more than welcome, as there are many more things to do!

Just as a sample:

1. Expand the [Geko.HttpClientService.CompleteSample](https://github.com/georgekosmidis/Geko.HttpClientService/tree/master/samples/Geko.HttpClientService.CompleteSample) with more functionality.
2. Support `JsonSerializerSettings` for `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<TResponseBody>(apiResponse.BodyAsString)` in [HttpClientService]( https://github.com/georgekosmidis/Geko.HttpClientService/blob/86262f016173bafd2c9ec4fbe70ac9eb1406042a/src/Geko.HttpClientService/HttpClientService.cs#L300).
3. Support more than IdentityServer4
4. Improve logging.
